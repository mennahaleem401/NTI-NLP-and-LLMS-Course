It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared.\n\nFirstly, please know that you're not alone, and there is help available. While I'm not a licensed therapist, I can offer some general guidance and suggestions that might help you manage your symptoms.\n\n**Seek Professional Help**: It's essential to talk to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can help you identify the underlying causes of your panic attacks and develop a personalized plan to manage them. They can also provide you with coping strategies and techniques to reduce your symptoms.\n\n**Breathing Techniques**: Deep breathing exercises can help calm your body and mind. Try inhaling slowly through your nose, holding your breath for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth. Repeat this process several times.\n\n**Relaxation Techniques**: Engage in activities that help you relax, such as progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, or meditation. You can find guided recordings online or through mobile apps like Headspace or Calm.\n\n**Physical Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help reduce anxiety symptoms. Try to incorporate gentle exercises, like yoga or walking, into your daily routine.\n\n**Grounding Techniques**: Focus on your five senses to ground yourself in the present moment. For example, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, or the sensation of the air on your skin.\n\n**Support Network**: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or a support group for emotional support. Sharing your feelings with others can help you feel less isolated and more supported.\n\n**Self-Care**: Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced diet, and engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n\nRemember, managing panic attack symptoms takes time and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for professional help when you need it.\n\nIf you're in immediate distress, please call your local emergency number or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) in the US.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these suggestions, Menna? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you or anything you'd like to talk about further?"
